* TODO 10.4 
The original STRIPS planner was designed to control Shakey the robot. Figure 10.14
shows a version of Shakey’s world consisting of four rooms lined up along a corridor, where
each room has a door and a light switch. The actions in Shakey’s world include moving from
place to place, pushing movable objects (such as boxes), climbing onto and down from rigid
objects (such as boxes), and turning light switches on and off. The robot itself could not climb
on a box or toggle a switch, but the planner was capable of finding and printing out plans that
were beyond the robot’s abilities. Shakey’s six actions are the following:
• Go(x, y, r), which requires that Shakey be At x and that x and y are locations In the
same room r. By convention a door between two rooms is in both of them.
• Push a box b from location x to location y within the same room: Push(b, x, y, r). You
will need the predicate Box and constants for the boxes.
• Climb onto a box from position x: ClimbUp(x, b); climb down from a box to position
x: ClimbDown(b, x). We will need the predicate On and the constant Floor .
• Turn a light switch on or off: TurnOn(s, b); TurnOff (s, b). To turn a light on or off,
Shakey must be on top of a box at the light switch’s location.
Write PDDL sentences for Shakey’s six actions and the initial state from Figure 10.14. Con-
struct a plan for Shakey to get Box 2 into Room 2 .



* STARTED 8.11
Complete the following exercises about logical senntences:
*** a. Translate into good, natural English (no xs or ys!):
∀ x, y, l SpeaksLanguage (x, l) ∧ SpeaksLanguage (y, l)
⇒ Understands (x, y) ∧ Understands(y, x).
**** answer
All people  that speak the same language, 
understand each other. 

*** b. Explain why this sentence is entailed by the sentence
∀ x, y, l SpeaksLanguage (x, l) ∧ SpeaksLanguage (y, l)
⇒ Understands (x, y).
**** answer
For any two people that speak the same language, 
one will understand the other. 
*** c. Translate into first-order logic the following sentences:
**** (i) Understanding leads to friendship.
***** answer
∀ x, y  Understands(x,y) ∧ Understand(y,x) ⇒ Friendship(x,y) 
∧ Friendship(y,x)
**** (ii) Friendship is transitive.
***** answer
∀ x, y , z Friendship(x,y)  ∧ Friendship(y,z) ⇒ Friendship(x,z) 
Remember to define all predicates, functions, and constants you use.


* TODO 9.3 
Suppose a knowledge base contains just one sentence, ∃ x AsHighAs(x, Everest ).
Which of the following are legitimate results of applying Existential Instantiation?
a. AsHighAs(Everest, Everest ).
b. AsHighAs(Kilimanjaro, Everest).
c. AsHighAs(Kilimanjaro, Everest) ∧ AsHighAs(BenNevis, Everest)
(after two applications)
** answer
All three are legit.  
a. (x/Everest)
b. (x/Kilimanjaro)
c. (x/Kilimanjaro), (x,BenNevis)

* 9.9
Suppose you are given the following axioms:
1. 0 ≤ 3.
2. 7 ≤ 9.
3. ∀ x x ≤ x.
4. ∀ x x ≤ x + 0.
5. ∀ x x + 0 ≤ x.
6. ∀ x, y x + y ≤ y + x.
7. ∀ w, x, y, z w ≤ y ∧ x ≤ z ⇒ w + x ≤ y + z.
8. ∀ x, y, z x ≤ y ∧ y ≤ z ⇒ x ≤ z
** a. Give a backward-chaining proof of the sentence 7 ≤ 3 + 9. (Be sure, of course, to use
only the axioms given here, not anything else you may know about arithmetic.) Show
only the steps that leads to success, not the irrelevant steps.
*** ANSWER
7 <= 3 + 9
S(7) theta((w/7),(x/0),(y,9),(z/3))
S(2)
7 <= 9   ∧ 0 <= 3 ⇒ 7 + 0 <= 9 + 3
S(4)  theta(x/7)
7 <= 7 + 0

S(6)
theta(x,9),(y,3)
9 + 3 <= 3 + 9 

S(8) 
theta(((7+0)/x), ((9+3)/y), ((3+9)/z))
7+0 <= (9 + 3) ∧ (9 + 3)<= (3 + 9) ⇒ 7+0 <=  3+9


S(8)
theta((7/x), ((7+0)/y), ((3+9/z)))
7 <= (7 + 0) ∧ (7 + 0)<= (3 + 9) ⇒ 7 <= 3 + 9

** b. Give a forward-chaining proof of the sentence 7 ≤ 3 + 9. Again, show only the steps
that lead to success.
*** ANSWER
7 <= 3 + 9

S(4)
S(7)
